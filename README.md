# Spam Mail Prediction

This project aims to classify emails as spam or ham using a machine learning model, specifically logistic regression. The model processes email data and predicts whether a given message is spam or genuine (ham), providing users with an efficient way to filter unwanted emails.

## Project Overview

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict whether an email is spam based on its content. Using the `TfidfVectorizer`, we convert the email text into numerical data that the model can analyze. This project is created on Google Colab and includes data pre-processing, training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload your dataset to Google Colab and load it using `pd.read_csv()`.
3. Run the notebook to train the model and test predictions.

## Workflow

### 1. Importing Dependencies
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

### 2. Data Collection & Pre-processing
- Load the email dataset from a CSV file.
- Replace any null values with empty strings to ensure consistency.

```python
raw_mail_data = pd.read_csv("/content/sample_data/mail_data.csv")
mail_dataset = raw_mail_data.where((pd.notnull(raw_mail_data)), '')
```

### 3. Label Encoding
- Assign numeric labels to the categories: `0` for spam and `1` for ham.
```python
mail_dataset.loc[mail_dataset['Category'] == 'spam', 'Category',] = 0
mail_dataset.loc[mail_dataset['Category'] == 'ham', 'Category',] = 1
```

### 4. Splitting Data
- Separate the dataset into features (`X`) and labels (`Y`).
- Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
```python code
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 3)
```

### 5. Feature Extraction
- Use `TfidfVectorizer` to transform text data into feature vectors, focusing on word frequency and relevance.
```python code
feature_extraction =  TfidfVectorizer(min_df = 1, stop_words = 'english', lowercase = True)
X_train_features = feature_extraction.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_features = feature_extraction.transform(X_test)
Y_train = Y_train.astype('int')
Y_test = Y_test.astype('int')
```

### 6. Model Training
- Train a logistic regression model using the transformed training data for spam detection.
```python code
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_features, Y_train)
```

### 7. Evaluation
- Measure model accuracy on training and test data to assess performance.
```python code
prediction_on_training_data = model.predict(X_train_features)
accuracy_on_training_data = accuracy_score(Y_train, prediction_on_training_data)
print("Accuracy on training data: ", accuracy_on_training_data)
prediction_on_test_data = model.predict(X_test_features)
accuracy_on_test_data = accuracy_score(Y_test, prediction_on_test_data)
print("Accuracy on test data: ", accuracy_on_test_data)
```

### 8. Prediction
- Test the model by making predictions on sample email messages to classify them as spam or ham.
```python code
input_mail1 = ["Thanks for your subscription to Ringtone UK your mobile will be charged Â£5/month Please confirm by replying YES or NO. If you reply NO you will not be charged"]
input_data_features = feature_extraction.transform(input_mail1)
prediction = model.predict(input_data_features)
print(prediction)
a = 'Ham Mail' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Spam Mail'
print(a)
```

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 96.7%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.6%

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional NLP preprocessing for improved accuracy.
- Experiment with different classification algorithms, such as SVM or Naive Bayes, to explore other modeling approaches.
